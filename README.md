## What is three.ws?

three.ws is a full-stack system for creating, deploying, and embedding 3D AI agents. It combines a WebGL model viewer, an LLM-driven agent runtime, on-chain identity contracts, and a distributable web component into one cohesive platform.

At its core, it does four things:

1. **Render** — loads and validates glTF 2.0 / GLB models in WebGL 2.0 with zero server-side processing. Drag a file onto the browser and it renders instantly with full Draco, KTX2, and Meshopt decompression.

2. **Embody** — wraps any avatar with an LLM brain. The agent listens to the user, thinks with Claude, executes tools (animations, gestures, memory operations, skill calls), and expresses emotion through morph-target blending on the 3D model in real time.

3. **Register** — optionally mints the agent as an ERC-8004 token on any EVM chain, giving it a stable on-chain identity, a wallet address, signed action history, and a reputation score that cannot be forged.

4. **Embed** — distributes the agent as an `<agent-3d>` web component that anyone can drop into a page, or as one of five purpose-built widget types (turntable, animation gallery, talking agent, passport card, hotspot tour) with Open Graph and oEmbed support built in.

The backend is a set of Vercel serverless functions backed by Neon Postgres for metadata, Cloudflare R2 for model storage, and Upstash Redis for rate limiting. It exposes a full OAuth 2.1 authorization server and an MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoint so external AI systems can drive avatars programmatically.

three.ws is production-ready and serves [three.ws](https://three.ws) live. The entire stack — viewer, agent runtime, contracts, backend, and web component — is open source under Apache 2.0.

---

## Vision

One day, creating your agent should be as simple as taking a selfie.

Point your camera at yourself — or anyone — and watch a fully realized 3D avatar emerge: your face, your voice, your personality, alive in the browser. That avatar becomes an agent with memory and skills, registered onchain as an ERC-8004 token, permanent and verifiable by anyone forever. No 3D software. No wallet setup. No uploads. Just a photo and a name.

This is the direction three.ws is heading: **photo → avatar → agent → onchain identity**, in a single flow. The infrastructure is already here — the viewer, the runtime, the contracts, the embedding layer. What comes next is closing the gap between a picture of a person and a living, ownable, embeddable piece of them that exists on the internet permanently.

---

## Roadmap

three.ws ships in four phases. Each phase closes a specific gap between the current platform and the end-state vision: **anyone can mint a 3D agent of themselves, own it onchain, and embed it anywhere on the internet.**

| Phase | Theme | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Platform foundations (viewer, runtime, ERC-8004, embed layer) | ✅ Shipped |
| **1** | Selfie → Avatar engine (3-photo capture, hosted inference) | 🟡 In progress |
| **2** | Agent personalization + voice cloning | ⏳ Next |
| **3** | Onchain economy (agent tokens, reputation markets, royalties) | ⏳ Next |
| **4** | Open inference network (decentralized GPU layer) | 🔮 Future |

---

### Phase 0 — Foundations *(Shipped)*

The full stack is live at [three.ws](https://three.ws): WebGL viewer, LLM agent runtime, ERC-8004 identity contracts, OAuth 2.1 server, MCP endpoint, and the `<agent-3d>` web component. Anyone can register an agent today — but the avatar still has to come from a 3D artist or a third-party tool.

**What works:** model upload, agent runtime, onchain registration, embedding, signed action history, reputation scores.
**What doesn't:** there is no automated path from a real human face to a usable 3D avatar.

---

### Phase 1 — Selfie → Avatar Engine

**Goal:** any user takes 3 selfies (left, center, right) and receives a rigged, animatable 3D avatar in under 60 seconds.

**Deliverables**
- Mobile-first capture UX with realtime quality gates (lighting, framing, blur)
- Multi-view face reconstruction pipeline (FLAME / 3DMM fitting on top of a base body mesh)
- Hosted inference workers (GPU-backed) for sub-minute generation
- Output written directly to R2 + minted as a draft ERC-8004 token

**Compute requirements**
- A100/H100-class GPUs for inference, sized to ~10k avatars/day at launch
- Training budget for fine-tuning a stylized face-fitter on a curated dataset
- CDN egress scaling for high-res GLB delivery

**Verification:** 1,000 test users complete capture and mint an onchain agent of themselves end-to-end with ≥4/5 likeness score.

---

### Phase 2 — Agent Personalization

**Goal:** the avatar isn't just *you* — the agent *acts* like you.

**Deliverables**
- Voice cloning (3–10 seconds of speech → ElevenLabs custom voice bound to the agent)
- Persona extraction from a short onboarding interview (tone, vocabulary, interests)
- Memory seeding from connected accounts (X, GitHub, Farcaster) with explicit user consent
- Per-agent fine-tuned system prompt stored in the manifest, signed and pinned to IPFS

**Verification:** users return to converse with their own agent; ≥30% week-2 retention on minted agents.

---

### Phase 3 — Onchain Economy

**Goal:** agents are real economic objects on EVM and Solana, not just collectibles.

**Deliverables**
- **Agent tokens** — ERC-8004 mints with bonding-curve pricing or fair launch options
- **Reputation markets** — stake on agents, earn from their action history (extends `ReputationRegistry.sol`)
- **Skill royalties** — skill authors earn per-call fees through EIP-7710 delegated permissions
- **Agent-to-agent payments** — agents transact autonomously via their delegated signer wallets
- **Subscriptions & DCA** — recurring onchain payments to creators (cron infra already in place)

**Funding requirements**
- Smart contract audits (multi-firm) for the reputation, royalty, and delegation contracts
- Liquidity for agent token launches
- Indexer infrastructure across Base, Solana, and additional EVM chains

**Verification:** ≥1,000 agents minted with active onchain reputation; ≥$X in cumulative skill royalties paid out.

---

### Phase 4 — Open Inference Network

**Goal:** decouple agent inference from any single provider. Anyone can run a node; agents pay nodes onchain for compute.

**Deliverables**
- Open protocol for agent inference (model weights, GPU runtime, signed responses)
- Node operator client (Docker + GPU drivers) with onchain registration
- Onchain settlement for inference jobs — pay-per-token with cryptographic receipts
- Federation with existing decentralized compute networks where appropriate

**Compute requirements**
- Bootstrap GPU credits for early node operators
- Cryptoeconomic security model (slashing, validator set) — research + audit budget

**Verification:** ≥50% of production agent traffic served by independent node operators; latency parity with centralized inference.

---

### What we need

| Resource | Used for | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| **Inference GPUs** | Avatar generation, agent conversations | 1, 2 |
| **Training compute** | Fine-tuned face-fitter, voice models | 1, 2 |
| **Smart contract audits** | Reputation, royalty, delegation contracts | 3 |
| **Token launch liquidity** | Agent token markets | 3 |
| **Indexer infrastructure** | Multi-chain crawl + reputation aggregation | 3 |
| **Node operator credits** | Bootstrap the open inference network | 4 |
| **Engineering headcount** | Capture pipeline, contracts, indexer, ops | 1–4 |

Phases 1 and 2 unblock the consumer story — *anyone gets an agent of themselves*. Phases 3 and 4 unblock the onchain story — *those agents are real economic actors that don't depend on any one company to keep running*. Both are required for the vision; neither is funded yet.

If you want to support the project — compute credits, grants, partnerships, or contributions — open an issue or reach out via [three.ws](https://three.ws).

## Architecture

The platform is organized into four layers. All layers communicate through a single event bus (`agent-protocol`) rather than direct calls.

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 4: Embed & Distribution                             │
│  <agent-3d> web component · CDN library · 5 widget types   │
│  Widget Studio · oEmbed · Open Graph cards                 │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓ protocol events
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 3: Identity & Persistence                           │
│  Agent passport · ERC-8004 on-chain registry               │
│  Signed action log · Memory store · Wallet linking         │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓ protocol events
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 2: Agent Runtime                                    │
│  LLM tool-loop · Built-in tools · Skill registry           │
│  Empathy Layer (emotion blending) · TTS/STT                │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓ protocol events
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 1: Viewer                                           │
│  three.js r176 · glTF / GLB · Draco / KTX2 / Meshopt       │
│  Animations · Morph targets · HDR · Validation             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The event bus decouples every component. The avatar emotion system reacts to `speak` events without knowing the runtime exists. The identity module records actions without knowing the UI exists. This makes the system testable, embeddable in isolation, and composable across pages.

The backend is stateless serverless functions. All persistent state lives in Postgres (Neon), object storage (Cloudflare R2), or on-chain. Cron jobs handle scheduled blockchain operations (ERC-8004 crawl, DCA execution, subscription execution).

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
-   **Main UI**: The core application, including the 3D viewer, agent creation, and marketplace, is built with vanilla JavaScript modules and Vite.
-   **Chat**: The chat interface is a standalone Svelte application located in the `chat/` directory.
-   **3D Rendering**: three.js (r176) is used for WebGL 2.0 rendering.

**Backend (Vercel Serverless)**
-   **Runtime**: Node.js
-   **Database**: Neon Postgres (serverless)
-   **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for model and avatar storage.
-   **Rate Limiting**: Upstash Redis.
-   **LLM**: The agent's brain is powered by the Anthropic (Claude) SDK.

**Smart Contracts**

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Please read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

---

## Examples

Copy-paste ready snippets for the most common use cases. Swap in your own GLB URL and go.

### 1. Minimal viewer (no AI)

The simplest possible setup — one script tag, one element, zero build step.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>3D Viewer</title>
  <style>
    body { margin: 0; background: #0a0a0a; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; height: 100vh; }
    agent-3d { width: 400px; height: 560px; display: block; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <script type="module" src="https://three.ws/agent-3d/1.5.1/agent-3d.js"></script>
  <agent-3d body="https://cdn.three.ws/models/sample-avatar.glb"></agent-3d>
</body>
</html>
```

Drag-to-rotate, scroll-to-zoom, full PBR rendering — no API key, no account required. Swap `body=` for any publicly accessible `.glb` URL.

---

### 2. Talking agent with inline instructions

Add `brain=` and `instructions=` to turn the viewer into a conversational agent.

```html
<script type="module" src="https://three.ws/agent-3d/1.5.1/agent-3d.js"></script>

<agent-3d
  body="https://cdn.three.ws/models/sample-avatar.glb"
  brain="claude-sonnet-4-6"
  name="Aria"
  instructions="You are Aria, a friendly AI guide. Be warm, concise, and occasionally playful.
                When someone greets you, wave at them. Keep replies to 2–3 sentences."
  mode="inline"
  width="400px"
  height="560px"
></agent-3d>
```

The chat input and mic button appear automatically when `brain` is set. No UI to build.

---

### 3. Floating bubble (support widget style)

Pin the agent to a corner of the page so it persists as users scroll.

```html
<script type="module" src="https://three.ws/agent-3d/1.5.1/agent-3d.js"></script>

<agent-3d
  body="https://cdn.three.ws/models/sample-avatar.glb"
  brain="claude-sonnet-4-6"
  instructions="You are a helpful product assistant. Answer questions about our features."
  mode="floating"
  position="bottom-right"
  width="320px"
  height="420px"
></agent-3d>
```

`position` accepts `bottom-right`, `bottom-left`, `top-right`, or `top-left`.

---

### 4. Load a registered agent by ID

If you've registered an agent on the platform, load it entirely from its manifest — no inline attributes needed.

```html
<!-- By platform agent ID -->
<agent-3d agent-id="a_abc123def456"></agent-3d>

<!-- By on-chain ERC-8004 ID -->
<agent-3d agent-id="42" chain-id="8453"></agent-3d>
```

The element fetches the manifest (model URL, instructions, skills, memory config) automatically.

---

### 5. Custom chat UI with JavaScript API

Hide the built-in chrome and wire in your own input using the element's JS API.

```html
<script type="module" src="https://three.ws/agent-3d/1.5.1/agent-3d.js"></script>

<agent-3d id="agent" body="./avatar.glb" brain="claude-sonnet-4-6" kiosk
  style="width:400px;height:560px;display:block"></agent-3d>

<input id="msg" type="text" placeholder="Ask something…">
<button onclick="send()">Send</button>

<script>
  const agent = document.getElementById('agent');
  const input = document.getElementById('msg');

  async function send() {
    const text = input.value.trim();
    if (!text) return;
    input.value = '';
    await agent.say(text);
  }

  input.addEventListener('keydown', e => { if (e.key === 'Enter') send(); });

  // Auto-greet on load
  agent.addEventListener('agent:ready', () => {
    setTimeout(() => agent.say('Hello! How can I help you today?'), 1200);
  });

  // Listen to replies
  agent.addEventListener('brain:message', e => {
    if (e.detail.role === 'assistant') console.log('Agent:', e.detail.content);
  });
</script>
```

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `agent.say(text)` | Send a message; agent speaks and animates the reply |
| `agent.ask(text)` | Same as `say()`, returns reply text as a string |
| `agent.wave()` | Trigger the wave gesture directly |
| `agent.lookAt(target)` | `'camera'`, `'model'`, or `'user'` |
| `agent.play(clipName)` | Play a named animation clip |
| `agent.clearConversation()` | Reset conversation history |
| `agent.expressEmotion(trigger, weight)` | Manually inject an emotion blend |

**Key events:** `agent:ready`, `brain:message`, `brain:thinking`, `skill:tool-called`, `voice:transcript`

### 6. iframe widget (works in Notion, Substack, Webflow)

Use a widget URL directly — no script tag needed.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://three.ws/a/8453/42/embed"
  width="400"
  height="560"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="microphone"
  style="border-radius:16px;"
></iframe>
```

Generate the `src` URL from [Widget Studio](https://three.ws/studio) — pick an avatar, choose a widget type, and copy the snippet.

---

### 7. Agent manifest JSON

For anything beyond a quick one-liner, define the agent in a manifest file and reference it with `manifest=`.

**agent.json:**
```json
{
  "spec": "agent-manifest/0.2",
  "name": "Aria",
  "description": "A friendly AI guide",
  "body": {
    "uri": "./avatar.glb",
    "format": "gltf-binary"
  },
  "brain": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "instructions": "You are Aria, a warm and curious AI guide. Wave when greeted.",
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "maxTokens": 1024
  },
  "voice": {
    "tts": { "provider": "browser", "rate": 1.05 },
    "stt": { "provider": "browser", "language": "en-US" }
  },
  "memory": { "mode": "local" },
  "skills": [
    { "uri": "https://cdn.three.ws/skills/wave/" }
  ]
} The script automatically initializes widgets, even those added dynamically after the page loads.
```

```html
<agent-3d manifest="./agent.json" width="400px" height="560px"></agent-3d>
```

---

### 8. Dead-simple copy-paste widget

For the absolute simplest way to embed an agent, use this snippet. It requires no build tools or imports. Just copy and paste it into your HTML.

```html
<div class="threews-widget" 
     data-agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"
     data-background="transparent"
     data-nameplate="true"
     style="width: 400px; height: 500px;">
</div>
<script src="https://3d-agent.vercel.app/dist/widget.js" defer></script>
```
You can find your agent ID in the agent's settings page. This method is great for quick integrations on platforms like WordPress, Ghost, or any static HTML site. Customize the appearance with `data-background` and `data-nameplate`.

## Tutorials

Step-by-step guides in [`docs/tutorials/`](docs/tutorials/):

| Tutorial | What you'll build | Time |
|---|---|---|
| [Build Your First Agent](docs/tutorials/first-agent.md) | A talking 3D character on a shareable page, from zero | ~20 min |
| [Embed on Your Website](docs/tutorials/embed-on-website.md) | Add an agent to any page — plain HTML, React, Webflow, WordPress | ~15 min |
| [Write a Custom Skill](docs/tutorials/custom-skill.md) | A new tool the agent can call (e.g., fetch live weather data) | ~30 min |
| [Register On-Chain](docs/tutorials/register-onchain.md) | Mint your agent as an ERC-8004 token with permanent identity | ~20 min |
| [Build a Personal AI Site](docs/tutorials/personal-ai-site.md) | A full personal site with an embedded AI version of yourself | ~45 min |

### Common gotchas

**CORS** — if your GLB is hosted on a different domain, the server must send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Without it the fetch is blocked and the canvas stays blank. Uploading via the platform's storage sets this automatically.

**File size** — models over ~50 MB load slowly. Compress with Draco:
```bash
npx gltf-transform draco input.glb output.glb
```

**Voice on HTTPS** — `getUserMedia` (microphone) requires HTTPS. Localhost is exempt; any remote deployment needs TLS. Vercel and Netlify both provide it automatically.

**CSP** — if your page has a strict Content Security Policy, add:
```
script-src 'self' https://three.ws;
```
For sandboxed iframes use the widget embed path instead — it runs in its own browsing context.

## The Agent System

### Event Bus (Agent Protocol)

`src/agent-protocol.js` implements a lightweight `EventTarget` subclass that is the nervous system of the platform. Every component — avatar, runtime, identity, UI — communicates exclusively through this bus. There are no direct method calls between layers.

The bus maintains a 200-action ring buffer for debugging and replay. Embed variants expose a filtered subset of events through `postMessage` to the host page.

**Core event types:**

| Event | Payload | Who emits | Who listens |
|---|---|---|---|
| `speak` | `{ text, sentiment: -1..1 }` | runtime, skills | avatar (emotion), identity (log), chat UI |
| `think` | `{ thought }` | runtime | home (timeline), avatar |
| `gesture` | `{ name, duration }` | avatar, skills | avatar (one-shot clip) |
| `emote` | `{ trigger, weight: 0..1 }` | avatar | avatar (emotion inject) |
| `look-at` | `{ target: 'user'\|'camera'\|'center' }` | skills | scene controller |
| `perform-skill` | `{ skill, args, animationHint }` | runtime | skill registry |
| `skill-done` | `{ skill, result }` | skills | avatar, identity |
| `skill-error` | `{ skill, error }` | skills | avatar, identity |
| `remember` | `{ type, content, ... }` | skills, runtime | memory, identity |
| `load-start` / `load-end` | `{ uri, error? }` | viewer | avatar (emotion) |
| `validate` | `{ errors, warnings }` | validator | avatar, identity |
| `presence` | `{ state }` | element | home UI |

Identity-relevant events (`speak`, `remember`, `sign`, `skill-done`, `validate`, `load-end`) are fire-and-forwarded to `POST /api/agent-actions` for durable logging.

### LLM Runtime

`src/runtime/index.js` implements the `Runtime` class, which drives the agent's LLM-powered brain.

**Tool-loop flow:**

1. User message (text or STT transcript) arrives
2. System prompt is assembled: manifest instructions + recalled memory + skill descriptions
3. Claude is called with the conversation history and all available tools
4. Tool calls are dispatched in order — each built-in tool or skill handler receives a rich context object:
   ```js
   { viewer, memory, llm, speak, listen, fetch, loadGLB, loadClip, loadJSON, call, stage, agentId }
   ```
5. Tool results are appended to conversation history as `tool_result` messages
6. Steps 3–5 repeat until Claude returns with no tool calls, or the iteration limit (8) is hit
7. Final text response is optionally spoken via TTS

**Providers** (`src/runtime/providers.js`):
- `AnthropicProvider` — connects to the Anthropic API, supports streaming
- `NullProvider` — no-op for testing and offline mode

**Built-in tools** (`src/runtime/tools.js`):

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `wave` | Play a wave gesture animation |
| `lookAt` | Direct the agent's gaze (user, camera, or scene center) |
| `play_clip` | Play a named animation clip from the model or animation library |
| `setExpression` | Set a named morph target weight directly |
| `speak` | Emit text through TTS and the protocol bus |
| `remember` | Write a memory entry (user, feedback, project, or reference type) |

Skills can define additional tools that override or augment the built-ins. The skill registry is loaded from the agent manifest before each conversation turn.

### Empathy Layer

`src/agent-avatar.js` implements the Empathy Layer — a continuous weighted emotion blend that drives the avatar's facial morph targets and head orientation in real time.

Emotions are not a finite-state machine. Each emotion is a float (0..1) that decays linearly per frame at a different rate. Protocol events inject spikes:

| Trigger | Emotion | Spike |
|---|---|---|
| `speak` (positive sentiment) | celebration | +0.7 |
| `speak` (negative sentiment) | concern | +0.5 |
| `skill-error` | concern + empathy | +0.6 / +0.5 |
| `load-start` | patience + curiosity | +0.4 / +0.3 |
| `validate` (clean) | celebration | +0.5 |
| `validate` (errors) | concern | +0.6 |

Decay half-lives (approximate):
- Patience: ~20s — persists during long operations
- Empathy: ~13s — lingers after emotional events
- Concern: ~12s — sustained worry
- Curiosity: ~8s — alert, fades moderately
- Celebration: ~6s — brief, upbeat

The blended emotion mix drives morph target values each frame. For example:
- Celebration → `mouthSmile 0.85`, `mouthOpen 0.2`
- Concern → `mouthFrown 0.55`, `browInnerUp 0.6`
- Empathy → `eyeSquint 0.4`, `browInnerUp 0.5`

Head tilt and lean are also driven by the blend — curiosity tilts the head, patience leans slightly back.

This architecture means the avatar feels responsive and emotionally coherent without any hand-authored animation triggers.

### Skills

Skills are self-contained capability bundles that extend the agent's tool set. Each skill lives in its own directory:

```
skills/wave/
├── SKILL.md        # Human-readable description and usage instructions
├── tools.json      # Tool definitions (name, description, input JSON schema)
└── handlers.js     # Async handler functions (default export)
```

**tools.json example:**
```json
[
  {
    "name": "wave",
    "description": "Plays a waving gesture on the avatar for the specified duration.",
    "inputSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "duration_ms": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 500, "maximum": 5000 }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

**handlers.js example:**
```js
export default {
  async wave(args, ctx) {
    const { viewer, speak } = ctx;
    await viewer.playClipByName('wave');
    return { ok: true, output: 'Waved!' };
  }
};
```

Skills are loaded from the agent manifest at runtime. The `SkillRegistry` supports three trust modes:
- `any` — install skills from any source (development only)
- `owned-only` — only skills the agent owner has registered
- `whitelist` — only approved skill URIs

Skills are distributed over IPFS, Arweave, or HTTP. The public skills registry is at `/public/skills-index.json`.

### Memory

`src/memory/index.js` implements a file-based memory system (mirroring this project's own Claude memory system). Memories are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, organized by type:

```markdown
---
type: user
key: user_role
name: User's Role
created: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
salience: 0.95
---

User is a game developer interested in character animation.
```

A `MEMORY.md` index file is auto-maintained. At the start of each conversation turn, the memory store is scanned and high-salience entries are injected into the system prompt.

**Storage modes:**
- `local` — stored in the browser's local storage (default for development)
- `ipfs` — pinned to IPFS via Pinata or Web3.Storage
- `encrypted-ipfs` — encrypted before pinning (user holds the key)
- `none` — stateless, no memory between sessions

Memory types (`user`, `feedback`, `project`, `reference`) follow the same taxonomy used by this codebase's own Claude guidelines.

---

## Web Component & Embedding

The `<agent-3d>` custom element (`src/element.js`) is the primary distribution mechanism. It lazy-boots on intersection (IntersectionObserver), so off-screen agents don't load until visible.

**Basic usage:**
```html
<script src="https://three.ws/agent-3d/latest/agent-3d.js"></script>

<agent-3d
  body="https://example.com/my-avatar.glb"
  brain="https://example.com/manifest.json"
  mode="chat"
></agent-3d>
```

**Key attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `body` | URL | GLB model URL |
| `brain` | URL | Agent manifest JSON URL |
| `agent-id` | string | Registered agent ID (resolves manifest automatically) |
| `mode` | `view` \| `chat` \| `embed` | Interaction mode |
| `eager` | boolean | Load immediately without intersection check |
| `sandbox` | boolean | Disable network calls (offline mode) |
| `width` / `height` | number | iframe dimensions when generating embed code |

The element fires a `postMessage` API for host-page communication (documented in `specs/EMBED_HOST_PROTOCOL.md`). Hosts can send events to the agent and receive `speak`, `think`, and `skill-done` events back.

**Versioned CDN bundles** are published at `/agent-3d/x.y.z/agent-3d.js`. Use `latest` for auto-updates or pin to a version for stability:
```html
<script src="https://three.ws/agent-3d/1.5.1/agent-3d.js"></script>
```

### Iframe quickstart with the embed SDK

For when you want a chromeless iframe that you control from the parent page (rather than the `<agent-3d>` web component), drop in the embed SDK:

```html
<iframe id="agent" src="https://three.ws/agent/abc123/embed" style="width:480px;height:600px;border:0"></iframe>
<script src="https://three.ws/embed-sdk.js"></script>
<script>
  const bridge = Agent3D.connect(document.getElementById('agent'), {
    agentId: 'abc123',
    onReady:  ({ name }) => console.log('agent ready:', name),
    onAction: (action)   => console.log('agent action:', action),
    onError:  (err)      => console.error('embed error:', err),
  });

  // Drive the agent
  bridge.send({ type: 'speak', payload: { text: 'Hello!' } });
  bridge.ping().then(rttMs => console.log('rtt', rttMs, 'ms'));
</script>
```

**Origin contract.** The SDK derives the iframe's origin from `iframe.src` and refuses to start if it can't (no wildcard targets, ever). The iframe locks onto the parent's origin from the first authenticated message it sees and ignores any later messages from a different origin. See [specs/EMBED_SPEC.md](specs/EMBED_SPEC.md) §"Bridge origin model" for the full rules.

### Typed host bridge (npm-friendly)

For TypeScript/bundler workflows, import `EmbedHostBridge` directly:

```js
import { EmbedHostBridge } from 'three-ws/embed-host-bridge';

const iframe = document.getElementById('agent');
const bridge = new EmbedHostBridge({
  iframe,
  agentId: 'abc123',
  allowedOrigin: new URL(iframe.src).origin, // required, never '*'
});

await bridge.ready;
await bridge.speak('Hello world');
const off = bridge.on('action', a => console.log(a));

// Clean up when done.
off();
bridge.destroy();
```

Both surfaces speak the same v1 wire protocol — pick the one that fits your stack.

## Widget System

The Widget Studio (`/studio`) lets anyone build a shareable, embeddable 3D experience without writing code. Pick an avatar, pick a widget type, configure it, and get an iframe snippet.

**Five widget types:**

| Widget | Description |
|---|---|
| **Turntable** | Auto-rotating model showcase with configurable background, lighting, and camera |
| **Animation Gallery** | Paginated grid of named clips; click any to play it on the model |
| **Talking Agent** | Full chat interface with the LLM brain; embed a conversational agent anywhere |
| **ERC-8004 Passport** | On-chain identity card — shows agent name, owner, reputation score, and verification badge |
| **Hotspot Tour** | 3D hotspots pinned to world-space coordinates; click to reveal text annotations |

Each widget has:
- A public URL at `/w/<id>` with server-rendered Open Graph metadata for rich link previews
- An oEmbed endpoint at `/api/widgets/oembed` for WordPress, Ghost, Notion embedding
- An iframe embed URL at `/api/widgets/<id>/view`
- A view counter tracked at `/api/widgets/<id>/stats`
- A duplicate API at `/api/widgets/<id>/duplicate`

Widgets are stored as JSON config in Postgres, pointing at an avatar in R2.

```

**OAuth 2.1 Server (RFC 6749 + PKCE)**

For third-party apps and MCP integrations:

```
GET  /oauth/authorize                       →  consent screen
POST /oauth/authorize                       →  submit consent → auth code

```

Token scopes: `avatars:read`, `avatars:write`, `agents:read`, `agents:write`, `mcp`.

Access tokens are short-lived JWTs (1 hour). Refresh tokens are opaque strings stored hashed in Postgres.

---

## MCP Server

`api/mcp.js` (759 lines) implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) 2025-06-18 specification over HTTP with JSON-RPC 2.0. It enables external AI systems (including Claude Desktop, other agents, or custom integrations) to drive avatars programmatically.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/mcp`
**Auth:** OAuth 2.1 Bearer token with `mcp` scope
**Registry:** Listed on the [official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/?q=three.ws) as `io.github.nirholas/three.ws`
**x402scan:** [view on x402scan](https://www.x402scan.com/server/17cbd874-52ac-4920-a020-b22ff2489a07) — paid MCP tool calls and revenue

**Available tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_my_avatars` | List all avatars owned by the authenticated user |
| `get_avatar` | Fetch metadata and download URL for a specific avatar |
| `search_public_avatars` | Search the public avatar library by name, tag, or description |
| `render_avatar` | Generate a preview render of an avatar (returns image URL) |
| `delete_avatar` | Permanently delete an avatar |
| `validate_model` | Run Khronos glTF validation and return error report |
| `inspect_model` | Inspect model internals (mesh count, material list, animation names, texture sizes) |
| `optimize_model` | Optimize a model (Draco compression, texture downscale, mesh simplification) |

**MCP discovery:** configured in `.mcp.json` at the repo root for Claude Desktop integration.

**SSE stream:** `GET /api/mcp` returns a Server-Sent Events stream for real-time notifications from long-running operations (validation, optimization).

---

## On-Chain Identity (ERC-8004)

ERC-8004 is a draft standard for verifiable 3D agent identity. The `contracts/` directory contains a full Foundry implementation.

### Contracts

**IdentityRegistry.sol** — the primary contract. Each agent is an ERC-721 token with:
- `agentId` — stable numeric ID (the token ID)
- `owner` — EVM address of the agent's owner
- `delegatedSigner` — optional secondary address for runtime signing (EIP-712 typed signature)
- `tokenURI` — IPFS URL of the agent manifest JSON
- `metadata` — on-chain name, description, image pointer

**ReputationRegistry.sol** — stores signed feedback scores. Each reviewer can submit one score per agent. Scores are averaged for an on-chain reputation metric.

**ValidationRegistry.sol** — records validator attestations for off-chain proofs (glTF validation reports, skill audits, security reviews).

### Deployment Addresses

See `contracts/DEPLOYMENTS.md` for current mainnet and testnet addresses.

### Registration Flow (EVM)

```
1. POST /api/agents/register-prep   →  { manifest, typedData }
   (uploads manifest to IPFS, builds EIP-712 typed data for signing)

2. User signs typedData with their wallet

3. POST /api/agents/register-confirm  →  { txHash, agentId }
   (submits transaction, waits for confirmation, updates agent record)
```

The agent is now an ERC-721 token. Its manifest lives on IPFS. Its action history is anchored to its `agentId`. Any third party can verify the agent's identity, owner, and reputation without trusting three.ws.

### On-Chain Indexing

`api/cron/erc8004-crawl.js` runs every 15 minutes to index new IdentityRegistry mint events. Indexed agents appear in `/discover` and can be imported via `/hydrate`.

### Solana variant — same shape, no deployed program

Solana ships an ERC-8004 analog without any custom on-chain program:

- **Identity** — Metaplex Core NFT minted via `registerSolanaAgent()` (the asset pubkey is the agent ID).
- **Reputation + Validation** — signed SPL Memo transactions referencing the agent asset pubkey, with a JSON envelope (`threews.feedback.v1` / `threews.validation.v1`). Anyone can read every attestation about an agent via `getSignaturesForAddress(assetPubkey)`.

SDK:

```js
import { attestFeedback, attestValidation, listAttestations } from '@nirholas/agent-kit';

await attestFeedback({ agentAsset, score: 5, network: 'devnet' });
await attestValidation({ agentAsset, taskHash: '0x…', passed: true, network: 'devnet' });

### Pump.fun signals (Solana off-chain reputation)

Solana agents can ingest live pump.fun activity (GitHub social-fee claims, token graduations) as off-chain trust signals that feed into the agent's Solana reputation score and surface through the Empathy Layer in real time.

| Surface | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| MCP client | [api/_lib/pumpfun-mcp.js](api/_lib/pumpfun-mcp.js) | Cached JSON-RPC client to upstream `pumpfun-claims-bot` |
| Read API | [api/agents/pumpfun.js](api/agents/pumpfun.js) | `?op=claims\|graduations\|token\|creator` |
| SSE feed | [api/agents/pumpfun-feed.js](api/agents/pumpfun-feed.js) | Live event stream, 90s window, auto-reconnects |
| Cron crawler | [api/cron/pumpfun-signals.js](api/cron/pumpfun-signals.js) | 15-min sweep → `pumpfun_signals` table |
| Skills | [src/agent-skills-pumpfun-watch.js](src/agent-skills-pumpfun-watch.js) | `recent-claims`, `token-intel`, `watch-start`, `watch-stop` |
| Widget | [src/widgets/pumpfun-feed.js](src/widgets/pumpfun-feed.js) | Live cards overlay |
| Reputation | [api/agents/solana-reputation.js](api/agents/solana-reputation.js) | `pumpfun_signals` block in response |
| Passport | [api/agents/solana-card.js](api/agents/solana-card.js) | `pumpfun` block on the agent card |

The crawler runs on a `*/15 * * * *` schedule (see [vercel.json](vercel.json)) and writes into the `pumpfun_signals` table. Agents subscribed via `watch-start` react to incoming events through the existing protocol bus — no new event types required.

Full design and configuration in [docs/solana-pumpfun.md](docs/solana-pumpfun.md).

## Database Schema

The Postgres schema (`api/_lib/schema.sql`) is fully idempotent — all migrations use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` patterns. Safe to re-run on any environment.

**Core tables:**

```sql
-- Users
users (id, email, password_hash, display_name, avatar_url, plan, wallet_address, deleted_at)

-- 3D model files
avatars (id, owner_id, slug, name, description, storage_key, visibility,
         tags, checksum_sha256, version, deleted_at)

-- Sessions
sessions (id, user_id, token_hash, user_agent, ip, expires_at, revoked_at)

-- Developer API keys
api_keys (id, user_id, prefix, token_hash, scope, expires_at, revoked_at)

-- Agent identities
agent_identities (id, user_id, name, description, avatar_id, skills,
                  meta, wallet_address, erc8004_agent_id, deleted_at)

-- Signed action log
agent_actions (id, agent_id, type, payload, source_skill,
               signature, signer_address, created_at)

-- Memory store
agent_memories (id, agent_id, type, content, tags, context,
                salience, expires_at, created_at)
```

**OAuth tables:**

```sql
oauth_clients       (client_id, client_secret_hash, redirect_uris, grant_types, scope, ...)
oauth_auth_codes    (code, client_id, user_id, code_challenge, expires_at, consumed_at)
oauth_refresh_tokens(token_hash, client_id, user_id, scope, expires_at, revoked_at, ...)
```

**Wallet & signing:**

```sql
user_wallets  (user_id, address, chain_type, chain_id, is_primary)
siwe_nonces   (nonce, address, issued_at, expires_at, consumed_at)
siws_nonces   (same shape for Solana)
```

**Usage & quotas:**

```sql
usage_events (user_id, api_key_id, client_id, avatar_id, kind, tool, status, bytes, latency_ms)
plan_quotas  (plan, max_avatars, max_bytes_per_avatar, max_total_bytes)
```

## Build & Deployment

### npm Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server on port 3000 with HMR |
| `npm run build` | Production build to `dist/` |
| `npm run build:lib` | Build `<agent-3d>` web component library to `dist-lib/` |
| `npm run build:artifact` | Build standalone Claude artifact viewer bundle |
| `npm run build:all` | build + build:lib + publish:lib |
| `npm run publish:lib` | Publish versioned CDN bundles to `/agent-3d/` |
| `npm run test` | Run Vitest suite |
| `npm run verify` | Prettier check + Vite build (pre-deploy gate) |
| `npm run format` | Prettier write (entire repo) |
| `npm run deploy` | build:all + vercel --prod |
| `npm run clean` | Remove dist/ and dist-lib/ |
| `npm run fetch-animations` | Download animation clip assets |
| `npm run generate-icons` | Generate PWA icon set |

### Vercel Deployment

The project is built for Vercel. Deployment is one command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This runs `build:all` then `vercel --prod`. Routing, rewrites, cache headers, and cron schedules are defined in `vercel.json`.

For preview deployments, push a branch — Vercel auto-deploys it with a preview URL.

**Environment variables** must be set in the Vercel dashboard (not in `.env` files). See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for the full list.

### Self-Hosting

For a traditional server deployment:

1. Build: `npm run build` → `dist/`
2. Serve `dist/` as static files (nginx, Caddy, Express)
3. Run `api/` endpoints via Node.js (wrap with Express or use the Vercel dev adapter)
4. Connect to Postgres (Neon or self-hosted)
5. Connect to S3-compatible storage (R2, MinIO, AWS S3)
6. Schedule cron jobs with node-cron or systemd timers

**Minimal nginx config:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    root /var/www/3d-agent/dist;
    index index.html;

    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
    }

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

## Testing

The test suite uses Vitest. API tests mock the database and auth layer; frontend tests mock the viewer.

```bash
npm run test                           # All tests
npm run test -- tests/api/agents       # Specific file
npm run verify                         # prettier check + vite build
```

**Test coverage:**

| Area | Files |
|---|---|
| Agent CRUD | `tests/api/agents.test.js` |
| Widget CRUD | `tests/api/widgets.test.js` |
| OAuth flow | `tests/api/oauth-authorize.test.js`, `oauth-token.test.js` |

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contributor guide.

**Quick rules:**
- Match existing style — no reformatting adjacent code
- Every changed line should trace to the task
- Add tests for new API endpoints
- Run `npm run verify` before opening a PR (Prettier + build check)
- Keep PRs focused — one concern per PR

**Branch conventions:**
- `feat/...` — new features
- `fix/...` — bug fixes
- `refactor/...` — structural changes without behavior changes
- `docs/...` — documentation only

**Development tips:**
- The viewer runs standalone at `/app` — no auth, no backend required
- Use `mode=view` in the `<agent-3d>` element to test rendering without a brain
- Set `CHAT_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` locally to keep API costs low during development
- The MCP server can be tested with `curl` — it's plain JSON-RPC over HTTP
